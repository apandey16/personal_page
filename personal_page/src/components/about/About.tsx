          Hello! I am Ansh Pandey, a goal-orientated, dedicated, and ambitious
          final year student at California Polytechnic State University, San
          Luis Obispo. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer
          Science and a minor in Entrepreneurship. I am a passionate software
          developer with a strong foundation in computer science and programming
          principles. I am proficient in Java, Python, C#, and
          Typescript/JavaScript. I have experience in full-stack web
          development, mobile app development, AWS, Firebase, and general
          software engineering principles. I am also familiar with cloud
          computing, machine learning, and data science. I am a quick learner
          and a team player who is always eager to learn new technologies and
          work on challenging projects.
        </p>
        <p className="justified-paragrphs">
          Rooted in a technical foundation, I am enthusiastic about working in
          settings where I can effectively bridge the gap between innovation and
          real-world application while solving global challenges. I have been
          able to do this at work as a Jr. Software Developer at Amazon. My
          academic journey has equipped me with a solid understanding of
          programming languages, data structures, algorithmic design, data
          science, and computational intelligence. I am particularly intrigued
          by the potential of quantum computing to enhance machine learning
          techniques and drive advancements in numerous sectors. Additionally, I
          have been exporessed to the world of entrepreneurship through my minor
          in Entrepreneurship. I have been able to work on projects in class
          that have taken me through the process of creating a business plan,
          pitching to investors, and creating a prototype. I hope to be able to
          use my technical skills and entrepreneurial mindset to be able to
          create a postive impact on the world.
        </p>
